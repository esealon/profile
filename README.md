# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Also Node.js needs to be installed from:
https://nodejs.org/en

Then from the terminal (example Gitbash) needs to be install all the components to been able to run the webpage. This has to be done inside the foler Profile, which is where all the files are. Once inside this folder from the terminal, the code to be run is: npm install. 
With this all the dependencies will be installed inside the folder just created by the terminal as node_modules.

After that, inside the same folder (Profile) in the terminal, the following code needs to be run: npm run dev

And then on any internet browser, the following HTTP can be use to access the webpage Profile: http://localhost:5173
